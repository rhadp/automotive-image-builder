summary: Verify kernel options - cmdline, loglevel, and debug_logging
description: |
  Builds an AIB image with predefined kernel command line options and runs a VM using this image.
  Verifies that `/proc/cmdline` inside the VM contains the expected kernel options.

  Test inputs:
    Custom a-i-b manifest, which defines kernel command line parameters, which should be used to boot the image created
    in the test.

  Expected results:
    - PASS: 'All kernel options verified successfully (cmdline, loglevel, debug_logging, quiet)'

  Results location:
    output.txt

require:
  - qemu-kvm
  - expect
  - socat
duration: 60m

# Tests, which require virtualization, usually take more time to run, so let's
# increase their priority to run earlier (helps parallel execution time)
