summary: Verify the sshd configuration and the location of authorized_keys file for the root user
description: |
  Builds an AIB image with root SSH keys and verifies the `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file
  contains the expected public key. Also checks that `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` has the expected settings.

  Test inputs:
    Custom a-i-b manifest, which specifies:
      - Public SSH key for user root, that can be used to SSH login to the image created in the test.
      - sshd configuration options, which will be set for sshd in the image created in the test.

  Expected results:
    - PASS: 'sshd_config, root_ssh_keys and sshd_config override validated successfully.'

  Results location:
    output.txt
