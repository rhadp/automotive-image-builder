summary: Verify that custom files and directories (exact paths or globs) are properly added to the image
description: |
  Builds an AIB image with custom files using direct paths and glob patterns,
  and verifies their presence in the output image according to the configured behavior.
  Also tests that invalid top-level paths are properly rejected during validation.

  Test inputs:
    - Custom a-i-b manifest with files in allowed directories (/etc, /var)
    - Invalid manifests with custom top-level directories and root-level files

  Expected results:
    - PASS: 'Image contains all required files'
    - PASS: 'Build failed as expected for custom top-level directory'
    - PASS: 'Build failed as expected for root-level file'
    - PASS: 'Path validation correctly rejects invalid paths'
