summary: Verify that var and var_qm partitions occupy the expected absolute size
description: |
  Builds an AIB image with explicitly defined absolute partition sizes
  and verifies that the created partitions match the expected sizes.

  Test inputs:
    Custom a-i-b manifest, which defines image size and partition sizes using absolute values for the image created
    in the test.

  Expected results:
    - PASS: "Partition 'var' size 524288000 bytes matches expected 524288000 ± 10240"
    - PASS: "Partition 'qm_var' size 314572800 bytes matches expected 314572800 ± 10240"
