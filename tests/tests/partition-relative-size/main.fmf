summary: Verify that var and var_qm partitions occupy the expected relative size
description: |
  Builds an AIB image with var and qm_var partitions defined by relative sizes
  and verifies that they occupy the expected fractions of the total image size.

  Test inputs:
    Custom a-i-b manifest, which defines image size using absolute value and partition sizes using relative values
    for the image created in the test.


  Expected results:
    - PASS: "Partition 'var' relative size 0.2 matches expected 0.2 ± 0.01"
    - PASS: "Partition 'qm_var' relative size 0.0999999 matches expected 0.1 ± 0.01"
