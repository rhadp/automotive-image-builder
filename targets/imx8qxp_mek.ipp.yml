    # The Fedora and Always Ready kernels is based in the most recent Linux kernel mainline version.
    # This board requires a custom kernel for two reasons:
    # 1. Having the driver to boot from the MMC as modules doesn't work.
    # 2. CS9 and CS10 automotive kernel doesn't support this board yet.
